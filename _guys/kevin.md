Kevin is a sophomore raised in the kind Midwestern land of Central Wisconsin, studying advertising and entrepreneurship. When heâ€™s not singing his little heart out, Kevin can always be found with a headphone in his ear, shamelessly plugging his extensive list of <a target='_blank' href='https://open.spotify.com/user/kbodonne?si=b3NxD-boQzaplA5II2iytw'>Spotify playlists.</a> In his free time, Kevin enjoys parading around campus in his Buddy the Elf costume and showering himself in orange juice out of love for his alma mater.
